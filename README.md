# Calculator

I created this calculator to solidify my current knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It does the basic operations of adding, subtracting, mulitplying, and dividing.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped solidify some of the things I have been learning with JavaScript. 

Two things that stand out:
1) The use of the Event interface that allows us to drill down into the Event data and maniplute it to perform the calculator operations. 
2) The concept of putting all of the buttons into an array by using the Array.from() method. From here I could apply an eventListener() to each button and then apply a Switch statement to do different opperations to different buttons!

The HTML and styling of the calculator was fun and I was able to play aronnd with some cool colors. I particularly like the dark gray for the calculator body.
I got more comfortable with styling with the :hover pseudo class by implementing transitions for the buttons.
