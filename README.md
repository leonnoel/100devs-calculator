This was coded along with MayanWolfe's April 4, 2022 Twitch stream. 
I followed along with the stream, then spent time going over the
code, fixing multiple errors I had made, and getting the code to 
work correctly. I did change the look of the calculator a bit from
the image provided with the project description.
