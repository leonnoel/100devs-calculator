<h3 align="center">Simple calculator website as my first attempt to work with OOP.</h3>

## How It's Made:

This was my first attempt at a simple calculator, I still was not able to implement OOP completely but I was able to make it functional.

## Optimizations

I'm planning to add a conditional to the code that prevents the user from entering a second ```.``` to the input if a number in the operation is already a decimal.
