### How to submit your code for review:

- Fork and clone this repo
- Create a new branch called answer
- Checkout answer branch
- Push to your fork
- Issue a pull request
- Your pull request description should contain the following:
  - (1 to 5 no 3) I completed the challenge
  - (1 to 5 no 3) I feel good about my code
  - Anything specific on which you want feedback!

Example:

```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
```

I recently completed the 100 devs caculator. where I implemented a calcutator to do basic calculations. Though not a perfect calculator It can perform basic calculation we use in our daily lives.

# also the reset == submit button

# things I learnt

- I further understood how the eval function works
  link to mdn
- I also used the setTimeout function to handle error output instead of bringing up an alert dialog which can disturb the UX.

- I feel if i want to work on a more complex version the eval won't work well
  open to ideas on improvement.

Thanks
