## How It&#39;s Made:

**Tech used:**  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The calculator was built using HTML and CSS to create the user interface and JavaScript to implement the functionality. The calculator has a basic layout with buttons for numbers, operators, and the clear button. When a button is clicked, the JavaScript code updates the display with the corresponding value.
## Optimizations

To optimize the calculator, I implemented a decimal point button to allow for more precise calculations. Additionally, I added a feature that allows the user to chain together multiple operations in a row, without having to hit the equals button after each one.

## Lessons Learned:

Through building this calculator, I gained experience in working with JavaScript and manipulating the DOM. I learned how to structure code for a simple application, how to handle user input, and how to perform basic calculations using JavaScript. I also learned about the importance of testing and debugging, and how to use the console to find and fix errors.
