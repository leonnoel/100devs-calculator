I used a tutorial to walk through the Javascript portion as I felt really out of depth with the object syntax and how it connects to the DOM. I learned a lot simply copying this but I would like to give a shot at rebuilding from scratch in a few weeks. 

I did push myself to make a cute, interactive design in lieu of excelling at the JS. It feels great to bring a vision to life with HTML and CSS-- while simple they are powerful and effective.
